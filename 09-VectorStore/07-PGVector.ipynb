        "`PGVector` is a PostgreSQL extension that enables vector similarity search directly within your PostgreSQL database, making it ideal for AI applications, semantic search, and recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is particularly valuable for who already use PostgreSQL who want to add vector search capabilities without managing separate infrastructure or learning new query languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Features** :\n",
        "1. Native PostgreSQL integration with standard SQL queries\n",
        "2. Multiple similarity search methods including L2, Inner Product, Cosine\n",
        "3. Several indexing options including HNSW and IVFFlat\n",
        "4. Support for up to 2,000 dimensions per vector\n",
        "5. ACID compliance inherited from PostgreSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages** :\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Free and open-source\n",
        "2. Easy integration with existing PostgreSQL databases\n",
        "3. Full SQL functionality and transactional support\n",
        "4. No additional infrastructure needed\n",
        "5. Supports hybrid searches combining vector and traditional SQL queries\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages** :\n",
        "1. Performance limitations with very large datasets (billions of vectors)\n",
        "2. Limited to single-node deployment\n",
        "3. Memory-intensive for large vector dimensions\n",

## Overview

> Repetitive evaluation is a method of more accurately measuring a model's performance by conducting multiple evaluations on the same dataset.

You can add repetition to the experiment. This notebook demonstrates how to use `LangSmith` for repeatable evaluations of language models. It covers setting up evaluation workflows, running evaluations on different datasets, and analyzing results to ensure consistency. The focus is on leveraging `LangSmith`'s tools for reproducible and scalable model assessments.

This allows the evaluation to be repeated multiple times, which is useful in the following cases:

- For larger evaluation sets
- For chains that can generate variable responses
- For evaluations that can produce variable scores (e.g., `llm-as-judge`)

You can learn how to run an evaluation from [this site](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/evaluate_llm_application#evaluate-on-a-dataset-with-repetitions).

## Performing Repetitive Evaluations with `num_repetitions`

`LangSmith` provides a simple way to perform repetitive evaluations using the `num_repetitions` parameter in the evaluate function. This parameter specifies how many times each example in your dataset should be evaluated.

When you set `num_repetitions=N`, `LangSmith` will:

Run each example in your dataset N times.

Aggregate the results to provide a more accurate measure of your model's performance.

For example:

If your dataset has 10 examples and you set `num_repetitions=5`, each example will be evaluated 5 times, resulting in a total of 50 runs.

## Define a function for RAG performance testing

Create a RAG system to use for performance testing.

```python
from myrag import PDFRAG


# Create a function to generate responses to questions.
def ask_question_with_llm(llm):
    # Create a PDFRAG object
    rag = PDFRAG(
        "data/Newwhitepaper_Agents2.pdf",
        llm,
    )

    # Create a retriever
    retriever = rag.create_retriever()

    # Create a chain
    rag_chain = rag.create_chain(retriever)

    def _ask_question(inputs: dict):
        # Context retrieval for the question
        context = retriever.invoke(inputs["question"])
        # Combine the retrieved documents into a single string.
        context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in context])
        # Return a dictionary containing the question, context, and answer.
        return {
            "question": inputs["question"],
            "context": context,
            "answer": rag_chain.invoke(inputs["question"]),
        }

    return _ask_question
```

In this tutorial, we use the `llama3.2` model for repetitive evaluations. Make sure to install [`Ollama`](https://ollama.com/) on your local machine and run `ollama pull llama3.2` to download the model before proceeding with this tutorial.

```python
!ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Repetitive evaluation of RAG using GPT models

This section demonstrates the process of conducting multiple evaluations of a RAG system using GPT models. It focuses on setting up and executing repeated tests to assess the consistency and performance of the RAG system across various scenarios, helping to identify potential areas for improvement and ensure reliable outputs.

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate, LangChainStringEvaluator

# Create a QA evaluator
cot_qa_evalulator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
    "cot_qa",
    config={"llm": ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)},
    prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
        "prediction": run.outputs["answer"],
        "reference": run.outputs["context"],
        "input": example.inputs["question"],
    },
)

dataset_name = "RAG_EVAL_DATASET"

# Run the evaluation
evaluate(
    gpt_chain,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=[cot_qa_evalulator],
    experiment_prefix="REPEAT_EVAL",
    # Specify the experiment metadata.
    metadata={
        "variant": "Perform repeat evaluation. GPT-4o-mini model (cot_qa)",
    },
    num_repetitions=3,
)
```

## Repetitive evaluation of RAG using Ollama models

This part focuses on performing repetitive evaluations of the RAG system using Ollama models. It illustrates the process of setting up and running multiple tests with Ollama, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the RAG system's performance with these specific models.

```python
# Create a QA evaluator
cot_qa_evalulator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
    "cot_qa",
    config={"llm": ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)},
    prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
        "prediction": run.outputs["answer"],
        "reference": run.outputs["context"],
        "input": example.inputs["question"],
    },
)

dataset_name = "RAG_EVAL_DATASET"

# Run the evaluation
evaluate(
    ollama_chain,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=[cot_qa_evalulator],
    experiment_prefix="REPEAT_EVAL",
    # Specify the experiment metadata.
    metadata={
        "variant": "Perform repeat evaluation. Ollama(llama3.2) (cot_qa)",
    },
    num_repetitions=3,
)
```

## What is Weaviate?

Weaviate is a powerful open-source vector database that revolutionizes how we store and search data. It combines traditional database capabilities with advanced machine learning features, allowing you to:

- Weaviate is an open source [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database).
- Weaviate allows you to store and retrieve data objects based on their semantic properties by indexing them with [vectors](./concepts/vector-index.md).
- Weaviate can be used stand-alone (aka _bring your vectors_) or with a variety of [modules](./modules/index.md) that can do the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities.
- Weaviate has a [GraphQL-API](./api/graphql/index.md) to access your data easily.
- Weaviate is fast (check our [open source benchmarks](./benchmarks/index.md)).

> ðŸ’¡ **Key Feature**: Weaviate achieves millisecond-level query performance, making it suitable for production environments.

## Why Use Weaviate?

Weaviate stands out for several reasons:

1. **Versatility**: Supports multiple media types (text, images, etc.)
2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Semantic Search
   - Question-Answer Extraction
   - Classification
   - Custom ML Model Integration
3. **Production-Ready**: Built in Go for high performance and scalability
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Multiple access methods through GraphQL, REST, and various client libraries


## Initialization
Before initializing our vector store, let's connect to a Weaviate collection. If one named index_name doesn't exist, it will be created.

### Creating Collections in Weaviate

The `create_collection` function establishes a new collection in Weaviate, configuring it with specified properties and vector settings. This foundational operation requires six key parameters:

**Required Parameters:**
- `client`: Weaviate client instance for database connection
- `collection_name`: Unique identifier for your collection
- `description`: Detailed description of the collection's purpose
- `properties`: List of property definitions for data schema
- `vectorizer`: Configuration for vector embedding generation
- `metric`: Distance metric for similarity calculations

**Advanced Configuration Options:**
- For custom distance metrics: Utilize the `VectorDistances` class
- For alternative vectorization: Leverage the `Configure.Vectorizer` class

**Example Usage:**
```python
properties = [
    Property(name="text", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
    Property(name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT)
]
vectorizer = Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai()
create_collection(client, "Documents", "Document storage", properties, vectorizer)
```

> **Note:** Choose your distance metric and vectorizer carefully as they significantly impact search performance and accuracy.

```python
from weaviate.classes.config import Property, DataType, Configure, VectorDistances
from typing import List


def create_collection(
    client: weaviate.Client,
    collection_name: str,
    description: str,
    properties: List[Property],
    vectorizer: Configure.Vectorizer,
    metric: str = "cosine",
) -> None:
    """
    Creates a new index (collection) in Weaviate with the specified properties.

    :param client: Weaviate client instance
    :param collection_name: Name of the index (collection) (e.g., "BookChunk")
    :param description: Description of the index (e.g., "A collection for storing book chunks")
    :param properties: List of properties, where each property is a dictionary with keys:
        - name (str): Name of the property
        - dataType (list[str]): Data types for the property (e.g., ["text"], ["int"])
        - description (str): Description of the property
    :param vectorizer: Vectorizer configuration created using Configure.Vectorizer
                       (e.g., Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai())
    :return: None
    """
    distance_metric = getattr(VectorDistances, metric.upper(), None)

    # Set vector_index_config to hnsw
    vector_index_config = Configure.VectorIndex.hnsw(distance_metric=distance_metric)

    # Create the collection in Weaviate
    try:
        client.collections.create(
            name=collection_name,
            description=description,
            properties=properties,
            vectorizer_config=vectorizer,
            vector_index_config=vector_index_config,
        )
        print(f"Collection '{collection_name}' created successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to create collection '{collection_name}': {e}")
```

Now let's use the `create_collection` function to create the collection we'll use in this tutorial.

```python
collection_name = "BookChunk"  # change if desired
description = "A chunk of a book's content"
vectorizer = Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(
    model="text-embedding-3-large"
)  # You can select other vectorizer
metric = "dot"  # You can select other distance metric
properties = [
    Property(
        name="text", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="The content of the text"
    ),
    Property(
        name="order",
        data_type=DataType.INT,
        description="The order of the chunk in the book",
    ),
    Property(
        name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="The title of the book"
    ),
    Property(
        name="author", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="The author of the book"
    ),
    Property(
        name="source", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="The source of the book"
    ),
]

create_collection(client, collection_name, description, properties, vectorizer, metric)
```

<pre class="custom">Collection 'BookChunk' created successfully.
</pre>

### Delete Collection

Managing collections in Weaviate includes the ability to remove them when they're no longer needed. The `delete_collection` function provides a straightforward way to remove collections from your Weaviate instance.

**Function Signature:**
- `client`: Weaviate client instance for database connection
- `collection_name`: Name of the collection to be deleted

**Advanced Operations:**
For batch operations or managing multiple collections, you can use the `delete_all_collections()` function, which removes all collections from your Weaviate instance.

> **Important:** Collection deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Always ensure you have appropriate backups before deleting collections in production environments.

```python
def delete_collection(client, collection_name):
    client.collections.delete(collection_name)
    print(f"Deleted index: {collection_name}")


def delete_all_collections():
    client.collections.delete_all()
    print("Deleted all collections")


# delete_all_collections()    # if you want to delete all collections, uncomment this line
delete_collection(client, collection_name)
```

<pre class="custom">Deleted index: BookChunk
</pre>

### List Collections

Lists all collections in Weaviate, providing a comprehensive view of your database schema and configurations. The `list_collections` function helps you inspect and manage your Weaviate instance's structure.

**Key Information Returned:**
- Collection names
- Collection descriptions
- Property configurations
- Data types for each property

> **Note:** This operation is particularly useful for database maintenance, debugging, and documentation purposes.


```python
def list_collections():
    """
    Lists all collections (indexes) in the Weaviate database, including their properties.
    """
    # Retrieve all collection configurations
    collections = client.collections.list_all()

    # Check if there are any collections
    if collections:
        print("Collections (indexes) in the Weaviate schema:")
        for name, config in collections.items():
            print(f"- Collection name: {name}")
            print(
                f"  Description: {config.description if config.description else 'No description available'}"
            )
            print(f"  Properties:")
            for prop in config.properties:
                print(f"    - Name: {prop.name}, Type: {prop.data_type}")
            print()
    else:
        print("No collections found in the schema.")


list_collections()
```

### Data Preprocessing

Before storing documents in Weaviate, it's essential to preprocess them into manageable chunks. This section demonstrates how to effectively prepare your documents using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for optimal vector storage and retrieval.

**Key Preprocessing Steps:**
- Text chunking for better semantic representation
- Metadata assignment for enhanced searchability
- Document structure optimization
- Batch preparation for efficient storage

> **Note:** While this example uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, choose your text splitter based on your specific content type and requirements. The chunk size and overlap parameters significantly impact search quality and performance.

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("./data/the_little_prince.txt") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.
    chunk_size=200,
    chunk_overlap=30,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)

split_docs = text_splitter.create_documents([raw_text])

print(split_docs[:20])
```

### Document Preprocessing Function

The `preprocess_documents` function transforms pre-split documents into a format suitable for Weaviate storage. This utility function handles both document content and metadata, ensuring proper organization of your data.

**Function Parameters:**
- `split_docs`: List of LangChain Document objects containing page content and metadata
- `metadata`: Optional dictionary of additional metadata to include with each chunk

**Processing Steps:**
- Iterates through Document objects
- Assigns sequential order numbers
- Combines document metadata with additional metadata
- Formats data for Weaviate ingestion

> **Best Practice:** When preprocessing documents, always maintain consistent metadata structure across your collection. This ensures efficient querying and filtering capabilities later.

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from langchain_core.documents import Document


def preprocess_documents(
    split_docs: List[Document], metadata: Dict[str, str] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Dict[str, object]]]:
    """
    Processes a list of pre-split documents into a format suitable for storing in Weaviate.

    :param split_docs: List of LangChain Document objects (each containing page_content and metadata).
    :param metadata: Additional metadata to include in each chunk (e.g., title, source).
    :return: A list of dictionaries, each representing a chunk in the format:
             {'properties': {'text': ..., 'order': ..., ...metadata}}
    """
    processed_chunks = []

    # Iterate over Document objects
    for idx, doc in enumerate(split_docs, start=1):
        # Extract text from page_content and include metadata
        chunk_data = {"text": doc.page_content, "order": idx}
        # Combine with metadata from Document and additional metadata if provided
        if metadata:
            chunk_data.update(metadata)
        if doc.metadata:
            chunk_data.update(doc.metadata)

        # Format for Weaviate
        processed_chunks.append(chunk_data)

    return processed_chunks


metadata = {
    "title": "The Little Prince",
    "author": "Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry",
    "source": "Original Text",
}

processed_chunks = preprocess_documents(split_docs, metadata=metadata)

## Manage vector store
Once you have created your vector store, we can interact with it by adding and deleting different items.

### Add Items to Vector Store

Weaviate provides flexible methods for adding documents to your vector store. This section explores two efficient approaches: standard insertion and parallel batch processing, each optimized for different use cases.

#### Standard Insertion
Best for smaller datasets or when processing order is important:
- Sequential document processing
- Automatic UUID generation
- Built-in duplicate handling
- Real-time progress tracking

#### Parallel Batch Processing
Optimized for large-scale document ingestion:
- Multi-threaded processing
- Configurable batch sizes
- Concurrent execution
- Enhanced throughput

**Configuration Options:**
- `batch_size`: Control memory usage and processing chunks
- `max_workers`: Adjust concurrent processing threads
- `unique_key`: Define document identification field
- `show_progress`: Monitor ingestion progress

**Performance Tips:**
- For datasets < 1000 documents: Use standard insertion
- For datasets > 1000 documents: Consider parallel processing
- Monitor memory usage when increasing batch size
- Adjust worker count based on available CPU cores

> **Best Practice:** Choose your ingestion method based on dataset size and system resources. Start with conservative batch sizes and gradually optimize based on performance metrics.

### Delete items from vector store

You can delete items from vector store by filter

First, let's search for documents that contain the text `Hum! Hum!` in the `text` property.

```python
filter_query = Filter.by_property("text").equal("Hum! Hum!")

searcher.keyword_search(
    query="Hum! Hum!",
    filter_query=filter_query,
    limit=3,
)
```

Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about-- about-- that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you'),

I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.\n"Hum! Hum!" replied the king. "Then I-- I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--"'),

Now let's delete the document with the filter applied.

```python
from weaviate.collections.classes.filters import Filter


def delete_by_filter(collection_name: str, filter_query: Filter) -> int:
    try:
        # Retrieve the collection
        collection = client.collections.get(collection_name)

        # Check the number of documents that match the filter before deletion
        query_result = collection.query.fetch_objects(
            filters=filter_query,
        )
        initial_count = len(query_result.objects)

        # Delete documents that match the filter condition
        collection.data.delete_many(where=filter_query)

        print(f"Number of documents deleted: {initial_count}")
        return initial_count

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred during deletion: {e}")
        raise


delete_by_filter(collection_name=collection_name, filter_query=filter_query)
```

<pre class="custom">Number of documents deleted: 3

    3



Let's verify that the document was deleted properly.

```python
searcher.keyword_search(
    query="Hum! Hum!",
    filter_query=filter_query,
    limit=3,
)
```

Great job, now let's dive into Similarity Search with a simple example.

----

## Finding Objects by Similarity

Weaviate allows you to find objects that are semantically similar to your query. Let's walk through a complete example, from importing data to executing similarity searches.

### Step 1: Preparing Your Data

Before we can perform similarity searches, we need to populate our Weaviate instance with data. We'll start by loading and chunking a text file into manageable pieces.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Breaking down large texts into smaller chunks helps optimize vector search performance and relevance.

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_weaviate.vectorstores import WeaviateVectorStore
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("./data/the_little_prince.txt") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.
    chunk_size=200,
    chunk_overlap=30,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)

split_docs = text_splitter.create_documents([raw_text])
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

vector_store = WeaviateVectorStore(
    client=client, index_name=collection_name, embedding=embeddings, text_key="text"
)
```

### Step 2: Perform the search

We can now perform a similarity search. This will return the most similar documents to the query text, based on the embeddings stored in Weaviate and an equivalent embedding generated from the query text.

```python
query = "What is the little prince about?"
searcher = WeaviateSearch(vector_store)
docs = searcher.similarity_search(query, k=1)

for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"\nDocument {i+1}:")
    print(doc.page_content)
```

<pre class="custom">
    Document 1:
    In the book, a pilot is stranded in the midst of the Sahara where he meets a tiny prince from another world traveling the universe in order to understand life. In the book, the little prince
</pre>

You can also add filters, which will either include or exclude results based on the filter conditions. (See [more filter examples](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/filters).)

It is also possible to provide `k`, which is the upper limit of the number of results to return.

```python
from weaviate.classes.query import Filter

filter_query = Filter.by_property("text").equal("In the book, a pilot is")

searcher.similarity_search(
    query=query,
    filter_query=filter_query,
    k=1,
)
```




<pre class="custom">[Document(metadata={'title': 'The Little Prince', 'order': 14, 'source': 'Original Text', 'author': 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry'}, page_content='In the book, a pilot is stranded in the midst of the Sahara where he meets a tiny prince from another world traveling the universe in order to understand life. In the book, the little prince')]</pre>



### Quantify Result Similarity

When performing similarity searches, you might want to know not just which documents are similar, but how similar they are. Weaviate provides this information through a relevance score.
> ðŸ’¡ Tip: The relevance score helps you understand the relative similarity between search results.

```python
docs = searcher.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=5)

for doc in docs:
    print(f"{doc[1]:.3f}", ":", doc[0].page_content)
```

<pre class="custom">0.700 : In the book, a pilot is stranded in the midst of the Sahara where he meets a tiny prince from another world traveling the universe in order to understand life. In the book, the little prince
    0.627 : and illustrate what would become his most famous book, The Little Prince (1943). Mystical and enchanting, this small book has fascinated both children and adults for decades. In the book, a pilot is

    - the narrator learns about the secret of the little princeâ€˜s life
    0.519 : [ Chapter 3 ]
    - the narrator learns more about from where the little prince came
</pre>

## Search mechanism

`similarity_search` uses Weaviate's [hybrid search](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/search-operators#hybrid).

A hybrid search combines a vector and a keyword search, with `alpha` as the weight of the vector search. The `similarity_search` function allows you to pass additional arguments as kwargs. See this [reference doc](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/search-operators#hybrid) for the available arguments.

So, you can perform a pure keyword search by adding `alpha=0` as shown below:

```python
docs = searcher.similarity_search(query, alpha=0)
docs[0]
```




<pre class="custom">Document(metadata={'title': 'The Little Prince', 'order': 110, 'source': 'Original Text', 'author': 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry'}, page_content='have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?"')</pre>



## Persistence

Any data added through `langchain-weaviate` will persist in Weaviate according to its configuration. 

WCS instances, for example, are configured to persist data indefinitely, and Docker instances can be set up to persist data in a volume. Read more about [Weaviate's persistence](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/persistence).

## Multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenancy](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multi-tenancy) allows you to have a high number of isolated collections of data, with the same collection configuration, in a single Weaviate instance. This is great for multi-user environments such as building a SaaS app, where each end user will have their own isolated data collection.

To use multi-tenancy, the vector store need to be aware of the `tenant` parameter. 

So when adding any data, provide the `tenant` parameter as shown below.

```python
# 2. Create a vector store with a specific tenant
vector_store_with_tenant = WeaviateVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, client=client, tenant="tenant1"  # specify the tenant name
)
```

<pre class="custom">2025-Jan-19 09:14 PM - langchain_weaviate.vectorstores - INFO - Tenant tenant1 does not exist in index LangChain_866945876dc24c83bb0247ce4324bdbd. Creating tenant.
</pre>

```python
results = vector_store_with_tenant.similarity_search(
    query, tenant="tenant1"  # use the same tenant name
)

for doc in results:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

<pre class="custom">"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about. 
    "Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
    have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?"
    figures do they think they have learned anything about him.
</pre>

```python
vector_store_with_tenant = WeaviateVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, client=client, tenant="tenant1", mt=True
)
```

<pre class="custom">2025-Jan-19 09:14 PM - langchain_weaviate.vectorstores - INFO - Tenant tenant1 does not exist in index LangChain_c07a19db3f994319935be1ccdeb957c0. Creating tenant.
</pre>

And when performing queries, provide the `tenant` parameter also.

```python
vector_store_with_tenant.similarity_search(query, tenant="tenant1")
```




<pre class="custom">[Document(metadata={'title': 'The Little Prince', 'order': 313.0, 'source': 'Original Text', 'author': 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry'}, page_content='"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about. \n"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.'),
     Document(metadata={'title': 'The Little Prince', 'order': 110.0, 'source': 'Original Text', 'author': 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry'}, page_content='have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.

## Retriever options

Weaviate can also be used as a retriever

### Maximal marginal relevance search (MMR)

In addition to using similaritysearch  in the retriever object, you can also use `mmr`.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="mmr")
retriever.invoke(query)[0]
```




<pre class="custom">Document(metadata={'title': 'The Little Prince', 'author': 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry', 'source': 'Original Text', 'order': 14}, page_content='In the book, a pilot is stranded in the midst of the Sahara where he meets a tiny prince from another world traveling the universe in order to understand life. In the book, the little prince')</pre>



## Use with LangChain

A known limitation of large language models (LLMs) is that their training data can be outdated, or not include the specific domain knowledge that you require.

Take a look at the example below:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
result = llm.invoke(query)
print(result.content)
```

<pre class="custom">"The Little Prince" is a novella written by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, first published in 1943. The story is narrated by a pilot who crashes in the Sahara Desert and meets a young boy who appears to be a prince. The little prince hails from a small asteroid called B-612 and shares his adventures and experiences as he travels from one planet to another.
    
    Throughout the story, the little prince encounters various inhabitants of different planets, each representing different aspects of human nature and society, such as a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a geographer, and a fox. These encounters serve as allegories for adult behaviors and societal norms, often highlighting themes of loneliness, love, friendship, and the loss of innocence.
    
    One of the central messages of the book is the importance of seeing with the heart rather than just the eyes, emphasizing that true understanding and connection come from emotional and spiritual insight rather than superficial appearances. The story also explores themes of childhood, imagination, and the essence of what it means to be human.
    
    Ultimately, "The Little Prince" is a poignant reflection on the nature of relationships, the value of love, and the wisdom that can be found in simplicity and innocence. It has resonated with readers of all ages and is considered a classic of world literature.

Vector stores complement LLMs by providing a way to store and retrieve relevant information. This allow you to combine the strengths of LLMs and vector stores, by using LLM's reasoning and linguistic capabilities with vector stores' ability to retrieve relevant information.

Two well-known applications for combining LLMs and vector stores are:
- Question answering
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

### Question Answering with Sources

Question answering in langchain can be enhanced by the use of vector stores. Let's see how this can be done.

This section uses the `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain`, which does the lookup of the documents from an Index. 

We can construct the chain, with the retriever specified:

```python
searcher = WeaviateSearch(vector_store)

chain = searcher.create_qa_chain(
    llm=llm, retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(), chain_type="stuff"
)
```

```python
chain.invoke(
    {"question": query},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```




<pre class="custom">{'answer': 'The Little Prince is about a pilot who is stranded in the Sahara Desert and encounters a tiny prince from another world. The prince is traveling the universe to understand life. The story is mystical and enchanting, captivating both children and adults for decades.\n\n',
     'sources': 'Original Text'}</pre>



### Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Another very popular application of combining LLMs and vector stores is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This is a technique that uses a retriever to find relevant information from a vector store, and then uses an LLM to provide an output based on the retrieved data and a prompt.

We begin with a similar setup:

We need to construct a template for the RAG model so that the retrieved information will be populated in the template.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

template = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Question: {question}
Context: {context}
Answer:
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

print(prompt)
```

<pre class="custom">input_variables=['context', 'question'] input_types={} partial_variables={} messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['context', 'question'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template="You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\nQuestion: {question}\nContext: {context}\nAnswer:\n"), additional_kwargs={})]
</pre>

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

rag_chain.invoke(query)
```




<pre class="custom">'"The Little Prince" is about a pilot who, while stranded in the Sahara, meets a young prince from another world who is exploring the universe to understand life. The story contrasts the prince\'s innocent perspective with the often misguided views of adults. It explores themes of love, loss, and the importance of seeing beyond the surface.'</pre>
